  description: |

    Bright Sky is a free and open-source weather API. It aims to provide an easy-to-use gateway to weather data that the [DWD](https://www.dwd.de/) – Germany's meteorological service – publishes on their [open data server](https://opendata.dwd.de/).

    The public instance at `https://api.brightsky.dev/` is free-to-use for all purposes, **no API key required**! Please note that the [DWD's Terms of Use](https://www.dwd.de/EN/service/copyright/copyright_artikel.html) apply to all data you retrieve through the API.

    > This documentation is generated from an OpenAPI specification. The current version is available from https://brightsky.dev/brightsky.yml.


    ## Quickstart

    * Check out [`/current_weather`](operations/getCurrentWeather) if you want to know what the weather's like _right now_.
    * Check out [`/weather`](operations/getWeather) for hourly weather observations and forecasts.
    * Check out [`/radar`](operations/getRadar) if you're looking for a high-resolution rain radar.
    * Check out [`/alerts`](operations/getAlerts) if you're interested in weather alerts.

    ... or keep reading below for some background information.


    ## Good to Know

    * **Geographical coverage**: due to its nature as German meteorological service, the observations published by the DWD have a strong focus on Germany. The _forecasts_ cover the whole world, albeit at a much lower density outside of Germany.
    * **Historical coverage**: Bright Sky serves historical data going back to January 1st, 2010. If you need data that goes further back, check out our [infrastructure repository](https://github.com/jdemaeyer/brightsky-infrastructure) to easily set up your own instance of Bright Sky!
    * **Source IDs**: Bright Sky's _source IDs_ are a technical artifact and – unlike the [DWD station IDs](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/klimadatendeutschland/stationsliste.html) and [WMO station IDs](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/help/stations_list_CLIMAT_data.txt) – have no meaning in the real world. When making requests to Bright Sky, try to avoid them and supply lat/lon or station IDs instead.

      summary: Current weather
      description: |
        Returns current weather for a given location.

        To set the location for which to retrieve weather, you must supply both `lat` and `lon` _or_ one of `dwd_station_id`, `wmo_station_id`, or `source_id`.

        This endpoint is different from the other weather endpoints in that it does not directly correspond to any of the data available from the DWD Open Data server. Instead, it is a best-effort solution to reflect current weather conditions by compiling [SYNOP observations](/operations/getSynop) from the past one and a half hours.

  /radar:
    get:
      summary: Radar
      description: |
        Returns radar rainfall data with 1 km spatial and 5 minute temporal resolution, including a forecast for the next two hours.

        Radar data is recorded on a 1200 km (North-South) x 1100 km (East-West) grid, with each pixel representing 1 km². **That's quite a lot of data, so use `lat`/`lon` or `bbox` whenever you can (see below).** Past radar records are kept for six hours.

        Bright Sky can return the data in a few formats. Use the default `compressed` format if possible – this'll get you the fastest response times by far and reduce load on the server. If you have a small-ish bounding box (e.g. 250 x 250 pixels), using the `plain` format should be fine.

        ### Quickstart

        This request will get you radar data near Münster, reaching 200 km to the East/West/North/South, as a two-dimensional grid of integers:

        [`https://api.brightsky.dev/radar?lat=52&lon=7.6&format=plain`](https://api.brightsky.dev/radar?lat=52&lon=7.6&format=plain)

        ### Content

        * The grid is a polar stereographic projection of Germany and the regions bordering it. This is different from the mercator projection used for most consumer-facing maps like OpenStreetMap or Google Maps, and overlaying the radar data onto such a map without conversion (reprojection) will be inaccurate! Check out our [radar demo](https://brightsky.dev/demo/radar/) for an example of correctly reprojecting the radar data using OpenLayers. Alternatively, take a look at the `dwd:RV-Produkt` layer on the [DWD's open GeoServer](https://maps.dwd.de/geoserver/web/wicket/bookmarkable/org.geoserver.web.demo.MapPreviewPage) for ready-made tiles you can overlay onto a map.
        * The [proj-string](https://proj.org/en/9.2/usage/quickstart.html) for the grid projection is `+proj=stere +lat_0=90 +lat_ts=60 +lon_0=10 +a=6378137 +b=6356752.3142451802 +no_defs +x_0=543196.83521776402 +y_0=3622588.8619310018`. The radar pixels range from `-500` (left) to `1099500` (right) on the x-axis, and from `500` (top) to `-1199500` (bottom) on the y-axis, each radar pixel a size of `1000x1000` (1 km²).
        * The DWD data does not cover the whole grid! Many areas near the edges will always be `0`.
        * Values represent 0.01 mm / 5 min. I.e., if a pixel has a value of `45`, then 0.45 mm of precipitation fell in the corresponding square kilometer in the past five minutes.
        * The four corners of the grid are as follows:
          * Northwest: Latitude `55.86208711`, Longitude `1.463301510`
          * Northeast: Latitude `55.84543856`, Longitude `18.73161645`
          * Southeast: Latitude `45.68460578`, Longitude `16.58086935`
          * Southwest: Latitude `45.69642538`, Longitude `3.566994635`

        You can find details and more information in the [DWD's `RV product info` (German only)](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/radarprodukte/formatbeschreibung_rv.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3). Below is an example visualization of the rainfall radar data taken from this document, using the correct projection and showing the radar coverage:

        ### Code examples

        > The radar data is quite big (naively unpacking the default 25-frames response into Python integer arrays will eat roughly 125 MB of memory), so use `bbox` whenever you can.

        #### `compressed` format

        With Javascript using [`pako`](https://github.com/nodeca/pako):

        ```js
        fetch(
          'https://api.brightsky.dev/radar'
        ).then((resp) => resp.json()
        ).then((respData) => {
          const raw = respData.radar[0].precipitation_5;
          const compressed = Uint8Array.from(atob(raw), c => c.charCodeAt(0));
          const rawBytes = pako.inflate(compressed).buffer;
          const precipitation = new Uint16Array(rawBytes);
        });
        ```

        With Python using `numpy`:

        ```python
        import base64
        import zlib

        import numpy as np
        import requests

        resp = requests.get('https://api.brightsky.dev/radar')
        raw = resp.json()['radar'][0]['precipitation_5']
        raw_bytes = zlib.decompress(base64.b64decode(raw))

        data = np.frombuffer(
            raw_bytes,
            dtype='i2',
        ).reshape(
            # Adjust `1200` and `1100` to the height/width of your bbox
            (1200, 1100),
        )
        ```

        With Python using the standard library's `array`:
        ```python
        import array

        # [... load raw_bytes as above ...]

        data = array.array('H')
        data.frombytes(raw_bytes)
        data = [
            # Adjust `1200` and `1100` to the height/width of your bbox
            data[row*1100:(row+1)*1100]
            for row in range(1200)
        ]
        ```

        Simple plot using `matplotlib`:
        ```python
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # [... load data as above ...]

        plt.imshow(data, vmax=50)
        plt.show()
        ```

        #### `bytes` format

        Same as for `compressed`, but add `?format=bytes` to the URL and remove the call to `zlib.decompress`, using just `raw_bytes = base64.b64decode(raw)` instead.

        #### `plain` format

        This is obviously a lot simpler than the `compressed` format. It is, however, also a lot slower. Nonetheless, if you have a small-ish `bbox` the performance difference becomes manageable, so just using the `plain` format and not having to deal with unpacking logic can be a good option in this case.

        With Python:
        ```python
        import requests

        resp = requests.get('https://api.brightsky.dev/radar?format=plain')
        data = resp.json()['radar'][0]['precipitation_5']
        ```

        If you supply either `warn_cell_id` or both `lat` and `lon`, Bright Sky will return additional information on that cell in the `location` field. Warn cell IDs are municipality (_Gemeinde_) cell IDs.

        ### Notes

        * The DWD divides Germany's area into roughly 11,000 "cells" based on municipalities (_Gemeinden_), and issues warnings for each of these cells. Most warnings apply to many cells.
        * Bright Sky will supply information on the cell that a given lat/lon belongs to in the `location` field.
        * There is also a set of roughly 400 cells based on districts (_Landkreise_) that is not supported by Bright Sky.
        * The complete list of cells can be found on the DWD GeoServer (see below).

        Returns a list of ten-minutely SYNOP observations for the time range given by `date` and `last_date`. Note that Bright Sky only stores SYNOP observations from the past 30 hours.

        To set the weather station for which to retrieve records, you must supply one of `dwd_station_id`, `wmo_station_id`, or `source_id`. The `/synop` endpoint does not support `lat` and `lon`; use the [`/sources` endpoint](/operations/getSources) if you need to retrieve a SYNOP station ID close to a given location.

        SYNOP observations are stored as they were reported, which in particular implies that many parameters are only available at certain timestamps. For example, most stations report `sunshine_60` only on the full hour, and `sunshine_30` only at 30 minutes past the full hour (i.e. also not on the full hour). Check out the [`/current_weather` endpoint](/operations/getCurrentWeather) for an opinionated compilation of recent SYNOP records into a single "current weather" record.
